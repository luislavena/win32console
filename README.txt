== DEPRECATION NOTICE

Win32::Console has been deprecated in favor of an external tool named ANSICON:

* http://adoxa.110mb.com/ansicon/index.html
* http://blog.mmediasys.com/2010/11/24/we-all-love-colors/

This project is left here for history purposes but no further development will be done.

== DESCRIPTION

Win32::Console allows controling the windows command line terminal
thru an OO-interface. This allows you to query the terminal (find
its size, characters, attributes, etc). The interface and functionality
should be identical to Perl's counterpart.

A port of Perl's Win32::Console and Win32::Console::ANSI modules.

This gem packages Gonzalo Garramuno's Win32::Console project, and includes
a compiled binary for speed. The Win32::Console project's home can be
found at:

  http://rubyforge.org/projects/win32console

== FEATURES

Win32::Console::ANSI is a class derived from IO that seamlessly
translates ANSI Esc control character codes into Windows' command.exe
or cmd.exe equivalents.

To ease usage, you can use in combination with term-ansicolor gem and avoid
writing ANSI codes manually.

== EXAMPLES

To output a simple bolded string, try this script:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'win32console'
  include Win32::Console::ANSI
  include Term::ANSIColor

  puts bold << "bolded text" << clear << " and no longer bold."
